# Users in Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID allows organizations to create and manage user identities. Users can authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID and access Azure resources based on their assigned permissions.

## What is a Microsoft Entra User?

A **Microsoft Entra user** is an identity that can authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID and access resources based on assigned permissions.

Users can represent:

- Employees
- Administrators
- Developers
- External users
- Other users who require access to organizational resources

---

## Types of Users

### Member Users

A **member user** normally belongs to the organization.

Example:

```text
john@company.com
```

Member users are commonly used for employees and internal users.

### Guest Users

A **guest user** is an external user who is invited to collaborate with the organization.

Example:

```text
external-user@example.com
```

Guest users can be given access to required resources without becoming internal members of the organization.

---

## User Properties

A Microsoft Entra user contains different properties used to identify and manage the user.

Common properties include:

- Display Name
- User Principal Name (UPN)
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Job Title
- Department
- Location
- Account Status

### Example

```text
Display Name: John Smith
User Principal Name: john@company.com
Job Title: Cloud Engineer
Department: IT
```

---

## User Principal Name (UPN)

The **User Principal Name (UPN)** is the sign-in name of a Microsoft Entra user.

Example:

```text
john@company.com
```

The UPN is commonly used when the user signs in to Azure and other Microsoft services.

---

## User Account Status

A Microsoft Entra user account can be **enabled** or **disabled**.

### Enabled User

An enabled user can authenticate and access resources for which they have permission.

### Disabled User

A disabled user cannot authenticate using the disabled account.

Disabling an account can be useful when a user temporarily or permanently no longer requires access.

---

## User Lifecycle

User management generally involves the following lifecycle:

```text
Create User
    │
    ▼
Assign Access
    │
    ▼
User Uses Resources
    │
    ▼
Disable User
    │
    ▼
Delete User
```

Administrators can manage users throughout their lifecycle based on organizational requirements.
